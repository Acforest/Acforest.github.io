I am a second-year postgraduate from Beijing Institute of Technology, and I received B.Eng from China Agricultural University in 2022.

My research interests include deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP), and I have been working on log-based anomaly detection and semantic communication leveraging NLP methods.
